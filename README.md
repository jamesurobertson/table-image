Converts an image into a table of potentially 100,000s of thousands of cells.

Best to use on smaller images. Larger images might crash your browser/tab.

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/jamesurobertson/table-image.git
$> cd table-image
$> python3 -m http.server (or other similar server)
```
