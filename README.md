### TABLE-IMAGE

Converts an image into a table of potentially 100,000s of thousands or millions of cells.

Best to use on smaller images. Larger images might crash your browser/tab.

### To Run Locally:

Run the following commands:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/jamesurobertson/table-image.git
$> cd table-image
$> python3 -m http.server
```

If you don't have python3 you can use any other similar server.
